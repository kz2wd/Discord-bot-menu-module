Thanks you for using the CludiMenus module for your discord bot writen in python

You should mainly use the file CludiMenus.py
It contain a menu class which uses embed and numbers to display and make choices

If you need it, there is example.py provided which shows an example of how you can setup a menu and use it.
It is basically the only documentation provided.

There is a file named CludiMenusExtension which contains more way to create menus.
I didn't spent a lot of time on it so I'm not sure everything work so good luck.
It uses letters as indicator so you can go up to 26 answers.
However, it might not be useful for short-term menus because the client will take a lot of time to display it.
